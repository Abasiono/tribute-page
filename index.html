 <div id='tribute-info '><h3 class='headline'>Here's a time line of Dr. Bourlag's life: </h3>
<ul class='tribute'><li><strong>1914</strong> - Born in Cresco,Iowa </li>

<br><br>

    <li><strong>1938</strong> - Marries wife of 69 years Margret Gibson. Gets laid off due to budget cuts. <br>
        Inspired by Elvin Charles Stakman, 
    he returns to school study under Stakman, <br>who teaches him about breeding pest-resistent plants. </li>
<br><br>

    <li><strong>1941</strong> - Tries to enroll in the military after the Pearl Harbor attack, but is rejected. <br>
        Instead, the military asked his lab to work on waterproof glue,
     <br>DDT to control malaria, disinfectants, and other applied science.</li>

<br><br>
     <li><strong>1942</strong>- Receives a Ph.D. in Genetics and Plant Pathology </li>
<br><br>

     <li><strong>1944</strong> - Rejects a 100% salary increase from Dupont, leaves behind his pregnant wife,<br>
        and flies to Mexico to head a new plant pathology program. <br>Over the next 16 years, his team breeds 6,000 different strains of disease<br>
         resistent wheat 
    - including different varieties for each major climate on Earth. </li>

<br><br>
    <li><strong>1945</strong>- Discovers a way to grown wheat twice each season, doubling wheat yields </li>
<br><br>

    <li><strong>1953</strong> - Crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat with a high-yeidling American breed,<br>
         creating a strain that responds well to fertilizer. 
    It goes on to provide 95% of Mexico's wheat. </li>
<br><br>

    <li><strong>1962</strong> - Visits Delhi and brings his high-yielding strains of wheat to the Indian subcontinent 
    in <br>time to help mitigate mass starvation due to a rapidly expanding population </li>
<br><br>

    <li><strong>1970</strong> - Receives the Nobel Peace Prize</li>
<br><br>

    <li><strong>1983</strong> - Helps seven African countries dramatically increase their maize and sorghum yields </li>

    <li><strong>1984</strong> - Becomes a distinguished professor at Texas A&M University </li>

<br><br>
    <li><strong>2005</strong> - states "we will have to double the world food supply by 2050." Argues that genetically modified crops are<br>
         the only way we can meet the demand, as we run out of arable land. Says that GM crops<br>
     are not inherently dangerous because "we've been genetically modifying plants and animals for a long time.
    <br>Long before we called it science, people were selecting the best breeds."  </li>

<br><br>
     <li><strong>2009</strong>- dies at the age of 95.</li>
